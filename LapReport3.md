Why is this useful? Well if I wanted to create space on my computer, I can search for files that are taking a lot of space on my computer. This would be way more efficient than browsing through my files and looking at the space each file is taking.

Another example would be <br>
command: 

```bash  
find . -size -1M -size +100k
```

output:

```bash
./government/About_LSC/commission_report.txt
./government/About_LSC/State_Planning_Report.txt
./government/Env_Prot_Agen/multi102902.txt
./government/Env_Prot_Agen/ctm4-10.txt

./government/Gen_Account_Office/im814.txt
./government/Gen_Account_Office/ai9868.txt
./government/Gen_Account_Office/May1998_ai98068.txt
./government/Gen_Account_Office/d02701.txt
./biomed/1471-2105-3-2.txt
./911report/chapter-13.4.txt
./911report/chapter-13.5.txt
./911report/chapter-13.2.txt
./911report/chapter-13.3.txt

./911report/chapter-6.txt

./911report/chapter-12.txt
```

As you can see, you can also use M to denote megabytes,k to denote kilobytes, and G to denote gigabytes. You can also set ranges as "+" means more than and "-" means less than. Again this would be incredibly useful to clear out space. Say you have a file that takes up over a gigabyte that you forgot you had and that you don't need anymore.Just change the "+" argument to "+1G" to find all files over a gigabyte.


2. -type

command: ```find . -type d```

output: 

```bash
.
./government
./government/About_LSC
./government/Env_Prot_Agen
./government/Alcohol_Problems
./government/Gen_Account_Office
./government/Post_Rate_Comm
./government/Media
./plos
./biomed
./911report
```

The type option allows you to filter based on a type. In this case "d" means directory. If I didnt include the type. I would get all files and directories in my current directory(technical). But if I only wanted to see all the directories that are under technical I would have a hard time if I did not filter. This is where the type option comes in handy.

Another way to use type would be to filter based on files.

command: ```find . -type f```


output: 

```bash
biomed/gb-2002-3-9-research0043.txt
biomed/1471-2415-3-5.txt
biomed/1471-2334-1-21.txt
biomed/gb-2001-2-7-research0025.txt
biomed/ar130.txt
biomed/1476-069X-2-7.txt
biomed/1472-6890-2-5.txt
biomed/ar118.txt
biomed/gb-2002-3-7-research0032.txt
biomed/1471-2253-2-5.txt
biomed/1471-2210-1-10.txt
```

Here I only included part of the output as there are a lot of files in technical. Again this is just a useful way to filter. If there were a lot of directories in technical and I only wanted the files, I would have to filter using this option.
